# [AI Art Weekly](https://aiartweekly.com) community posts

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

If you're an AI artist that found an interesting way of
utilizing AI, you've come to the right place.

With this repo I want to give others a chance to share their unique workflows
with a larger audience through https://aiartweekly.com.

Checkout the guide below on how to contribute.

## How to contribute

- [Fork](https://github.com/dreamingtulpa/aiartweekly-posts/fork) this
  repository and add your post.
- Add a new markdown file to the `/posts` directory with the following format:
  `YYYY-MM-DD-slug`. For `YYYY-MM-DD`, just use the current date. I'll update it with
  the date of publishing once I publish it. For `slug` use a parameterized
  version of your post title.
- To keep this repo small in size, make sure URLs to images/assets are absolute
  and hosted somewhere so I can download them when importing your posts into
  aiartweekly.com.
- Add an new markdown file to the `/authors` directory and reference it in your
  post file at the top. You can use the filename of your author file (minus the
  `.md` extension) to reference your author profile.
- After you're done, submit a [Pull
  Request](https://github.com/dreamingtulpa/aiartweekly-posts/compare) with your
  changes.
